# PFPY
Repository containing Python and DPL scripts for automation in DigSILENT PowerFactory - power system analysis software.

Code is far from optimal, written in a limited timeframe, specific purpose and with poor commenting. Due to very limited amount of similar code on github, I still think some people might find this useful and copy and modify parts of the code for their purposes.

Most of the code is used to process excel/csv files with data and import it into powerfactory for simulation purposes. The imput data is confidential and cannot be uploaded.  

Code was used on PowerFactory version 2022, SP1, but it should work with other versions. Make sure to include the correct powerfactory.pyd library.
