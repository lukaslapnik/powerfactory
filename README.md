# PFPY
Repository containing Python scripts for automation in PowerFactory power system analysis software.

Code is far from optimal, written in a limited timeframe, specific purpose and with poor commenting. Due to very limited amount of similar code on github, I still think some people might find this useful and copy and modify parts of the code for their purposes.

Most of the code is used to process excel/csv files with data and import it into powerfactory for simulation purposes. These files/data cannot be uploaded due to NDA. 

Code was used on PowerFactory version 2022, SP1, but it should work with other versions. Make sure to include the correct powerfactory.pyd library.
