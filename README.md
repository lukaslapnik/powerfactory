# Powerfactory scripts

Repository containing Python and DPL scripts for automation in DigSILENT PowerFactory - power system analysis software.

Code is far from optimal, written in a limited timeframe, specific purpose and with poor commenting. Due to very limited amount of similar code on github, I still think some people might find this useful. You can freely copy and modify parts of the code for your purpose.

Most of the code is used to process excel/csv files with data and import it into powerfactory for simulation purposes. The imput data is confidential and cannot be uploaded, but I can share some of the scripts.  

Code was used on PowerFactory version 2022, SP1, but it should work with other versions. Make sure to include the correct powerfactory.pyd library.

I shared DPL scripts in plain text. You have to manually create a DPL script in PowerFactory software, define the variables and then paste the script code. Info is included in the beginning of the txt file.
